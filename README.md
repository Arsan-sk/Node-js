# Node.js Practice Workspace

Welcome — this repository is a personal Node.js learning workspace. It contains small practice projects, experiments, and notes created while learning and practicing Node.js concepts. Each folder typically represents a new topic, a focused exercise, or a small project used to explore a feature or pattern in Node.js.

## Goals
- Record practical learning exercises and experiments.
- Keep small, focused projects that demonstrate individual Node.js concepts.
- Provide an easy-to-scan structure so you can revisit and extend experiments later.

## Quick summary
- Language: JavaScript (Node.js)
- Purpose: Practice and demonstrate Node.js topics (routing, templating, utilities, simple servers, etc.)
- Author / GitHub: Arsan-sk

## How to use this repository

Prerequisites
- Node.js (LTS recommended)
- npm or yarn

Basic steps to run a practice project
1. Open a project folder (for example a folder under this repository that contains an entry point such as `index.js` or `server.js`).
2. Run `npm install` if a `package.json` exists and dependencies are declared.
3. Start the project:
   - `node index.js` or `node server.js` (if that is the entry script), or
   - `npm start` (if a start script exists in `package.json`).
4. Check console output for the port and then open your browser (typically http://localhost:3000 or the indicated port).

Note: Some folders are simple HTML views that do not require Node to preview — open them in a browser for static inspection.

## Project / Folder structure (typical)
This repository may contain the following folders. Not every repository will have all of them — use them as a guideline for how I organize practice work.

- `/routes`  
  Contains route definitions and Express route handlers. Each file often maps to a small feature or a route group.

- `/utils`  
  Utility functions and helpers used by examples and small projects (formatters, validators, small libraries).

- `/views`  
  HTML templates or static view files used by the examples. These are minimal templates to demonstrate rendering, form handling, and small UI exercises.

- `/public` (optional)  
  Static assets like CSS, images, and client-side JavaScript for demos.

- `/models` (optional)  
  Simple data models or mock data stores used during practice (not necessarily a full ORM).

- `/controllers` (optional)  
  Small controller files when code is separated into controllers and routes.

- `/scripts` (optional)  
  Helpful scripts to seed data or run small automation tasks for demos.

- `/tests` (optional)  
  Unit or integration tests for exercises.

- `package.json` (if present)  
  Declares dependencies and scripts for Node-based practice projects.

- `README.md`  
  This file — explains the repository and how to work with it.

## Conventions and organization tips
- Keep each exercise self-contained in its folder (e.g., `practice-routing`, `learning-async`, `simple-api`).
- Add a short README inside larger practice folders explaining the goal and how to run that specific exercise.
- Use descriptive file names: `index.js`, `server.js`, `routes.js`, `utils/validation.js`.
- Prefer minimal, focused code for learning; avoid mixing multiple topics in one folder.

---

## Common examples you will find here
- Simple Express server with a few routes and HTML views.
- Form handling and POST routes (e.g., add listing forms).
- Small utilities (validation, formatting).
- Static pages inside `views` to test CSS/UX ideas.
- Lightweight examples for middleware, error handling, and redirects.

---

## How to add a new practice session
1. Add a new folder under the repo root with a concise name like `practice-<topic>` (e.g., `practice-express-middleware`).
2. Include a short README in that folder explaining goals and run instructions.
3. Add minimal dependencies and an entry file (`index.js` or `server.js`).
4. Commit regularly with clear messages describing what you practiced.

---

## Tips for future improvements
- Add small `package.json` files per practice folder where dependencies are required.
- Use Git branches to explore breaking changes or large refactors.
- Add tests inside `/tests` for examples you want to stabilize.
